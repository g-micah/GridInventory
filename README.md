# GridInventory

This application is a spacial grid inventory built in the Unity environment using C#.

The idea behind this inventory system is that you have a grid of blocks in your inventory and each item takes a certian amount of blocks depending on its size and shape. It should not allow you to place items in the inventory if there is no space for it. It should also give a preivew of where the dragged item will drop using green if the space is available and red if it is not.

The core of the code and logic is in the 'Scripts' folder. While the world was built in class with a professor at a seperate date, the inventory menu itself was built soley by me from scratch, using a few public image assets.
